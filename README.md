## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use **grid-template-areas** property to controle the flow of my elements:

```css
.grid-wrapper {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-areas: "description image";
}
```

Also i learned how to use **object-fit** property to controle the behavior of my image:

```css
img {
    object-fit: cover;
}
```
Also i learned how to work with version controle system **Git** and remote repository with **GitHub**, so i can submit my solution to this chalenge in [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) website.


### Continued development

I'm still not comfortable with controlling images, and grid technique. That's what i'm willing to practice in [Frontend Mentor chalenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges).

### Useful resources

- [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped to find and understand every property in css and every tag in html5.
